# More about the system working:
                              I developed a touchless control system that uses my laptop's webcam to detect my hand. The mouse cursor syncs with my hand movements, allowing the cursor to move as I move my hand. When I bring my index finger and thumb close together, the mouse enters drag mode, enabling me to move icons on the screen. Essentially, when my fingers touch, the mouse remains in click mode, allowing for seamless interaction with the desktop environment.
